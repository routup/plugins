# What is it?

**Routup** is a lightweight, minimalistic and extendable http interface based routing framework.
It uses node's vanilla request and response interfaces, which are injected into route handlers aka middlewares as function argument.

Helpers provide additional functionalities to transform and interact with the request and manipulate the response upstream.
