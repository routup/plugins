# What is it?

SAPIR (**S**imple **API** **R**outer) is a minimalistic http based routing framework.
It uses node's vanilla request and response interfaces, which are injected into route- & middleware-handlers as function argument.
Helpers provide additional functionalities to transform and interact with the request and manipulate the response upstream.
 
::: warning **Important NOTE**

The package is still in heavy development and is therefore not production ready.
Besides, the README.md is missing important parts, which are not covered yet.
