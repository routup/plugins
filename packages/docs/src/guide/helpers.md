# Helpers

Helpers exist to transform and interact with the incoming [request](./api-reference-request-helpers.md) and manipulate the [response](./api-reference-response-helpers.md) upstream.

The most important response helper, is properly the [send](./api-reference-response-helpers.md#send) helper, 
which sends any (optional) data to client and terminates the request on completion.
